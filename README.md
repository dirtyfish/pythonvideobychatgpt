All the code was written by chatGPT, and the prompt for the code was also
refined by chatGPT. Some code was moved and some deleted. As the part work
well isolated, but needs some minor adjustments to work better together.

I never created a program that would install necessary part including pip
automatically, and I think it is cool if it works. It seems to work well when
run from text editor, some issues when run from command line.

Just run this, or open and copy this into you python editor:

Link to output:

A few cosmetic changes was done after initial output from the prompt.


The prompt:


1. Create a Python script that installs the necessary packages for video generation. 
   Use 'pip install opencv-python numpy' to install OpenCV and NumPy.

2. Develop a script using the installed packages to generate a 720p video. 
   The video should showcase six bouncing balls of different colors, each moving independently and interacting with the frame's edges. 
   Include sleek text at the bottom of each frame, indicating that the video was made with ChatGPT. 
   Provide detailed text output during the video generation process, including frame numbers, positions of each ball, 
   and information about the program and video creation (e.g., timestamps, credits, acknowledgments). 
   The video should consist of 600 frames.

3. Add a script command at the end of the program that automatically opens the generated video file. 
   Provide clear instructions for viewing the video using the default video player on different operating systems 
   (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

   

And here is the random squirrel:
